Not only does this drastically simplify both installation and scaling, but it also eliminates a major network security vulnerability in the IT infrastructure. <br /><br />Features like LLDP insights, offline device alerting, and built-in remote troubleshooting tools reduce time to resolution and free up personnel to make IT improvements, providing added business value. And, because MV is managed through the browser-based Meraki dashboard and operates using a licensing model, there's no need to purchase, download, and maintain any additional software. Management through the Meraki dashboard ensures firmware updates will continually roll out over the lifespan of the product, meaning its value will only increase over time. <br /><br />Featuring an industry-leading processor, these cameras are not only capable of providing high definition (1080p) video, but they also allow for on-board analytics capabilities that previously required additional software and heavy-duty hardware. Harnessing the power of computer vision and machine learning, this camera line can dynamically classify people as objects within a frame.

213716,install4j Windows Edition - License - 1 developer - Win,,"<ul><li>Advanced JRE bundling. One of the core requirements for a Java-aware installer builder is the ability to bundle a JRE with the installer. With features like download-on demand, Pack200 compression or shared installations of JRE bundles, install4j stands out in this area as well. Pre-packaged JRE bundles can be easily downloaded from within the IDE making JRE bundling a one minute exercise.</li> <li>All other features are supported. Aside from the restriction on the media file types, no other features are missing the Windows Edition.</li> <li>Rich screen and action system. With install4j, you can configure the screen flow for the installer and uninstaller in any way you like. install4j provides screens and actions for a wide variety of use cases and allows you to create your own actions directly in the install4j IDE. Actions can be attached to each screen, making install4j a visual programming system far more powerful than traditional installer builders.</li> <li>Exceptional ease of use. Some installer builders require that you first become an expert in building installers. Not so with install4j, where all configuration steps are intuitive and self-explanatory. The install4j IDE guides you naturally through the process of gathering required information. Building an installer that works is a matter of minutes. Nonetheless, you have a powerful arsenal of functionality at your disposal when you need it.</li> <li>Simple creation of custom screens. Querying information from the user that's specific to your application does not have to be hard. Besides programming your own custom screens, install4j includes a unique concept of form screens that look good and are easy to configure. With its powerful variable system, install4j enables you to use the entered information in other screens and actions. Creating a user interface cannot get any easier than this.</li> <li>Extensive i18n support. install4j fully supports you in localizing your installer to multiple languages. It offers a large number of installer languages and an easy mechanism to introduce new keys for your own messages in the installer. You can build single-language or multi-language installers that detect the actual language at runtime.</li> <li>Beautiful installers. The installer is the first thing your users see of your application. A smooth installation experience is an important step in creating happy users and a successful product. A substandard installer, however, can ruin the initial impression that is so important for the image of a product. With install4j, your installers will look beautiful and feel natural to users on all platforms.</li> <li>Create media files for Microsoft Windows. The ""Windows installer"" and the ""Windows archive"" media file types can be generated with the Windows Edition.</li> <li>Fully flexible auto-updaters and custom applications. install4j offers several templates for updaters that enable you to create an auto-update solution for your application with just a few clicks. Auto-updaters are fully customizable, so they can support your special requirements for a large number of scenarios. More generally, install4j supports the creation of custom installer applications that are packaged with your application.</li> <li>Build Windows media files on other platforms. With the Windows Edition, you can build your Windows media files on all other supported platforms, such as Linux or Mac OS X.</li> <li>Extensibility. install4j is extensible. With its JavaBeans-based extension model and its well-documented API, you can add your own actions, screens and form components to the component registries in install4j. All pre-defined components in install4j are programmed that way. With this flexibility, you can quickly integrate your own code into the installer or create extensions that can be reused in multiple projects.</li></ul>","install4j is a powerful multi-platform Java installer builder that generates native installers and application launchers for Java applications. install4j excels in its ease of use, its extensive platform support and its powerful screen and action system.

Recorded motion alerts can easily be reviewed by using the Smart Search function.</p> <p><b>Take an active stance against uninvited guests</b></p> <p>This camera comes with plenty of features that will help ward off uninvited guests. First, there is a motion-activated warning light that can be customized to only be triggered when a person or vehicle is detected.
